git branch mybranch

git checkout mybranch

git checkout -b mybranch
# Creates a new branch called "mybranch" and makes it the active branch


git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git checkout mybranch
# Makes "mybranch" the active branch

git checkout master
# Makes "master" the active branch
git merge mybranch
# Merges the commits from "mybranch" into "master"
git branch -d mybranch
# Deletes the "mybranch" branch
